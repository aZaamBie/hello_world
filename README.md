My First Github repository

Hey, aZaamBie here! I'm new to Github, I've heard about it before and finally created an account!
I like to program a lot with Python, sometimes developing websites with Html and CSS (might start learning JavaScript soon).

I will probably deploy websites that I will be developing and sometimes I will deploy Python projects!
